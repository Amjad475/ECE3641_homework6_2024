# QUiCK SUMMARY
 
 In this assignment, I worked on creating two ROS nodes, talker.py and listener.py, using ROS Melodic on Ubuntu 18.04. I started by setting up a ROS workspace in the directory ~/ece3641-homework6-2024/catkin_ws and created a package called amjad. Using Visual Studio Code, I wrote the talker.py node to send messages and the listener.py node to receive and process them. After finishing, I needed to upload a demo video to YouTube and save my project in a private GitHub repository, adding my instructor as a collaborator.

This project helped me understand how ROS nodes communicate. The talker.py node sends messages on a topic, while the listener.py node listens to and processes those messages. This showed me how ROS systems work by allowing different parts of a robot to share information without directly depending on each other. I learned how this design makes systems more organized, flexible, and able to handle multiple tasks at once. Overall, this assignment gave me useful experience with ROS and helped me understand the basics of building communication between robot components
